# Combination of Measurements

The combination of measurements is described in its latest version in Combination Notes [pp 8 TeV](https://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Notes/node/522), [pp 2.76 TeV](https://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Notes/node/484), from which all details about the procedures itself can be extracted. 
Further details about the combination of triggers within one method can be obtained from the respective analysis notes of the measurements, linked in [Analysis Notes and Papers](/Introduction/notes.md).
