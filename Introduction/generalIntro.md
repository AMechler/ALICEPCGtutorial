# Welcome to the Photon Conversion Framework Tutorials!

## General Naming Scheme and Analysis Task Names

In our framework there we follow a common naming scheme and several abbreviations will occur frequently. When we are talking about the **meson analysis**, we usually refer to the _neutal pion and eta analysis_. While when we are talking about the **photon analysis** we generally mean the _direct photon analysis_.   
Within the software package different reconstruction techniques are implemented: 

| Abbreviation | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Conversions \(Conv, PCM\) | Photon reconstruction via conversion in the detector material based on the electrons and positrons reconstructed in the TPC |
| Calo \(EMCal, DCal PHOS\) |  Photons reconstructed via their energy deposit in the calorimeters  |
