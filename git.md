# Git

Git is a very powerful version control system which is very popular (and it is also used for all our software repositories). 
You are expected to know about Git and to be able to work with it. 
If you don't know how to push, pull, rebase and configure Git, you should have a look at the given links below and learn about Git.

It is recommended to use a visualization tool as it eases your workflow and gives you direct insight into the state of a repository and the status of all the branches. There are two different tools which are recommended to use:

1: _gitk_ 

In general, you can install it via your package manager, for example:
> sudo apt-get install gitk

For more information see [gitk](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk).

2: _tig_

In general, you can install it via your package manager, for example:
> sudo apt-get install tig

For more information see [tig](http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/manual.html).
