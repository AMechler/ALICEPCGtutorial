# Git

Git is a very powerful version control system which is very popular (and it is also used for all our software repositories). 
You are expected to know about Git and to be able to work with it. 
If you don't know how to push, pull, rebase and configure Git, you should have a look at the given links below and learn about Git.

Working with _gitk_ is recommended (very nice tool to visualize commits, their contents and the different branches), but not necessary [gitk](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk).
