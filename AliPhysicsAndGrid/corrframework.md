#The EMCal correction framework

The full set of EMCal calibrations was previously handled by the Tender and was composed of several tasks that were, by demand, added to the analysis chain. The EMCal group has introduced a new framework for the handling of the corrections/calibrations which in addition brings many more useful features. The framework was thoroughly tested by the group and verified to yield the same results as using the Tender.
